# MazeGame

MazeGame is a competitive maze-solving game where the player competes against an AI to navigate through a randomly generated maze. The game includes treasures, penalties for wrong paths, and a scoring system. The goal is to reach the maze's end with the highest score.

## Features
- **Two-player Competition**: One player and one AI solve the maze simultaneously.
- **Treasure System**: Randomly placed treasures in the maze provide additional challenges.
- **Scoring**:
  - Collect treasures to increase your score.
  - Wrong paths decrease the score.
- **Dynamic Pathfinding**: The AI navigates the maze using random path exploration.
- **Visuals**: The game uses the `turtle` graphics module to render the maze and player movements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Turtle Graphics**: Used for rendering the maze and visualizing player movements.
- **Threading**: Handles concurrent actions of the player and AI.
- **mttkinter**: Enhances the graphical interface with tkinter multithreading capabilities.
